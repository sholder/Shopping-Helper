Bugs:
* Changing orientation on main screen makes buttons scroll off screen

Features:
* Add test app (figure out what unit tests even make sense)
* Create an icon
* Get command line build working
* Styling:
  + List links (make them look like buttons)
  + Visited links shouldn't change color
  + Make h1s look pretty
  
Done:
* Back hardware button should work
* Back links should be always visible on all pages (Removed, back button fixed)
* Changing orientation takes user back to index.html
